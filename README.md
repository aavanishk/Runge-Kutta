# Discription of Runge Kutta method and it's implementation
<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>The Runge-Kutta method is a numerical technique used for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) or systems of ODEs. It is a family of iterative methods that provides a way to approximate the solution of differential equations when an analytical solution is difficult or impossible to find.</p>
